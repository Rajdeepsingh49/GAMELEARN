          WHAT IS A ONLINE GAME 
      </h2>
       
        <p class="t">
          An online game is a video game that is either partially or primarily
          played through the Internet or any other computer network available.
          Online games are ubiquitous on modern gaming platforms, including PCs,
          consoles and mobile devices, and span many genres, including first-person 
          shooters, strategy games and massively
          multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). In 2019, 
          revenue in the online games segment reached $16.9 billion, 
          with $4.2 billion generated by China and $3.5 billion in the
          United States. Since 2010s, a common trend among online 
          games has been operating them as games as a service, using
          monetization schemes such as loot boxes and battle passes
          as purchasable items atop freely-offered games. Unlike 
          purchased retail games, online games have the problem of not
          being permanently playable, as they require special servers 
          in order to function.
          The design of online games can range from simple text-based 
          environments to the incorporation of complex graphics and virtual worlds. The existence of
          online components within a game can range from being minor features, such as an online leaderboard,
          to being part of core gameplay, such as directly playing against other players. Many online games create 
          their own online communities, while other games, especially social games, integrate the players' existing
           real-life communities.
          Online gaming has drastically increased the scope and size
          of video game culture. Online games have attracted players
          from a variety of ages, nationalities, and occupations.
          The online game content can also be studied in the scientific field,
          especially gamers' interactions within virtual societies in relation to the 
          behavior and social phenomena of everyday life. As in other cultures, 
          the community has developed a gamut of slang words or phrases that can be used
          for communication in or outside of games. Due to their growing online nature,
          modern video game slang overlaps heavily with internet slang, as well as leetspeak
          , with many words such "pwn", "GG", and "noob". The culture of online gaming sometimes
          faces criticisms for an environment that can promote cyberbullying, violence, and xenophobia.
          Some are also concerned about gaming addiction or social stigma. However, it has been argued
          that, since the players of an online game are strangers to each other and have limited communication,
          the individual player's experience in an online game is not necessarily different from playing with
          artificial intelligence players.

          HISTORY OF ONLINE GAMES

      </h2>

      <p class="t">
        The history of online games dates back to the early days of packet-based computer
        networking in the 1970s, An early example of online games are MUDs, including the first,
        MUD1, which was created in 1978 and originally confined to an internal network before becoming 
        connected to ARPANet in 1980. Commercial games followed in the next decade, with Islands of
        Kesmai, the first commercial online role-playing game, debuting in 1984, as well as more 
        graphical games, such as the MSX LINKS action games in 1986, the flight simulator Air Warrior
        in 1987, and the Famicom Modem's online Go game in 1987.
        The rapid availability of the Internet in the 1990s led to an expansion of online games, with notable
        titles including Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds (1996), Quakeworld (1996), Ultima Online (1997), 
        Lineage (1998), Starcraft (1998), Counter-Strike (1999) and EverQuest (1999). Video game consoles
        also began to receive online networking features, such as the Famicom Modem (1987), Sega Meganet
        (1990), Satellaview (1995), SegaNet (2000), PlayStation 2 (2000) and Xbox (2001). Following
        improvements in connection speeds, more recent developments include the popularization of new
        genres, such as social games, and new platforms, such as mobile games.
        Entering into the 2000s, the cost of technology, servers and
        the Internet has dropped so far that fast Internet was
        commonplace, which led to previously unknown genres
        like massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) becoming well-known
        . For example, World of Warcraft (2004) dominated much of the decade.
        Several other MMOs attempted to follow in Warcraft's footsteps, such
        as Star Wars Galaxies, City of Heroes, Wildstar, Warhammer Online, Guild 
        Wars 2, and Star Wars: The Old Republic, but failed to make a significant im
        pact in Warcraft's market share. Over time, the MMORPG community has developed 
        a sub-culture with its own slang and metaphors, as well as an unwritten list of 
        social rules and taboos.
        Separately, a new type of online game came to popularity alongside World of Warcraft,
        Defense of the Ancients (2003) which introduced the multiplayer online battle arena
        (MOBA) format. DotA, a community mod based on Warcraft III, gained in popula
        rity as interest in World of Warcraft waned, but since the format was tied to the Wa
        rcraft property, others began to develop their own MOBAs, including Heroes of Newert
        h (2009), League of Legends (2010), and Dota 2 (2013). Blizzard Entertainment, t
        he owner of Warcraft property, released their own take on the MOBA genre with Heroes
        of the Storm (2015), emphasizing on numerous original heroes from Warcraft III and o
        ther Blizzard's franchises. By the early 2010s, the genre has become a big part o
        f the esports category.
        In the late 2010s, the battle royale game format became widely popular with the release of
        PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (2017), Fortnite Battle Royale (2017), and Apex Legends (20
        19). Popularity of the genre continued in 2020s with the release of the Call of Duty: War
        zone (2020). Each game has received tens of millions of players within months of their re
        leases.
